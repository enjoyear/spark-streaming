#   When adopting this option, both the driver and executor should use the same image (keep the custom jars in the same location)
# spark.kubernetes.container.image            spark-wordcount:v2

# Option 2: use `spark.jars` to distribute jars.
#   In this case, the jar can be under the subdirectory of $SPARK_HOME/jars in driver
#   1. Driver startup: Spark scans the spark.jars paths on driver
#   2. Executor provisioning: Driver creates executor pods via K8s API
#   3. JAR upload: Driver starts an HTTP file server
#   4. Executor startup: Executors download JARs from driver's HTTP server to their local cache
#   5. Classpath setup: Executors add downloaded JARs to their classpath

## Only the driver will be cleaned up when the deployment is deleted, but the executors are created by the driver.
## Set it to true if you want the executors to be removed after termination; otherwise, we can also configure ownerReferences on executor pods
## Executors will start and fail until driver can be connected.
## Set it to false to maintain the terminated executors if you want to check the logs after termination.
## For manual clean up:
## kubectl get pods -n spark-operator -l spark-role=executor --show-labels | grep ContainerCreating
## kubectl get pods -n spark-operator -l spark-role=executor | grep -E "Error|Completed" | awk '{print "kubectl delete pod "$1" -n spark-operator"}' | bash
## kubectl delete pods -n spark-operator -l spark-role=executor -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.status.containerStatuses[*].state.waiting.reason=="ContainerCreating")]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'
## Clean up config maps:
## kubectl get configmaps -n spark-operator -l spark-role=executor

# Driver reachability
## - localhost (127.0.0.1) refers specifically to the local machine via a private internal loopback interface, which is
## only accessible by processes running on the host machine itself. Not reachable from other devices on the same network or the internet.
## - 0.0.0.0 is a "wildcard" meta-address used when binding a service to listen for connections on all available network interfaces (internal and external)
## It accepts connections on all IPv4 addresses assigned to the machine, including the loopback address (127.0.0.1),
## the local area network (LAN) IP address (e.g., 192.168.x.x), and any public IP addresses.
## This allows the driver to accept connections from any network interface (e.g., eth0 inside the container), not just localhost
